Files-
README.txt
MSS_Problems.txt
MSS_Results.txt
Input_and_Output.c
Testing_for_Correctness.c
Experimental_Analysis.c

Execution of all files is simple.
For Input_and_Output.c, The MSS_Problems.txt and Input_and_Output.c file should be in same folder and text file should be in same format.
Writes the output to a file called MSS_Results.txt


compiling: 
gcc -o Input_and_Output Input_and_Output.c
./Input_and_Output

gcc -o Testing_for_Correctness Testing_for_Correctness.c
./Testing_for_Correctness

prints TEST SUCCESFULL, IF all tests are passed.

gcc -o Experimental_Analysis Experimental_Analysis.c -lrt
./Experimental_Analysis

prints size of array, maximum sum of subarray of each algorithm and average run time in Micro Seconds.

Tested the above commands on Ubuntu 14.04 Terminal with gcc 4.9.3 and works fine.
